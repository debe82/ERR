# European Rat Repository

The EER is a web application that aims to help volounteers, vets and adopters to exchange information and keep track of the adoptions. 
Since mid 2010 the "rats as pets" trend has incresed in all Europe, but as for dogs and cats owners started to discard the rats in the woods or in the park since most of
the pet shops don√πt care if male and female lives in the same group. This leads to the females to get pregnant and giving birth to 7-12 new rats.
THIS README AS THE PROJECT IS STILL WORKING IN PROGRESS!
